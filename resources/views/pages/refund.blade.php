            <h3>1. Overview</h3>
            <p>At Net Bundle, we strive to provide excellent service and instant delivery of data bundles. This Refund Policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued and the process for requesting a refund.</p>
            <p>Please read this policy carefully before making a purchase. By using our services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Refund Policy.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- General Policy -->
          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>2. General Refund Policy</h3>
            <p><strong>No Refunds for Successfully Delivered Bundles:</strong> Due to the instant and digital nature of our services, we generally do not offer refunds for data bundles that have been successfully delivered to the specified phone number.</p>
            <p>Once a data bundle is activated on a mobile number, it cannot be reversed, transferred, or refunded. All sales are considered final upon successful delivery.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Eligible for Refund -->
          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>3. Circumstances Eligible for Refund</h3>
            <p>Refunds may be issued in the following specific circumstances:</p>

            <h5>3.1 Technical Failure</h5>
            <p>If payment was successfully processed but the data bundle was not delivered due to a technical error on our end, you are eligible for either:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
              <li>A full refund of the purchase amount, or</li>
              <li>Redelivery of the purchased bundle</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3.2 Duplicate Charges</h5>
            <p>If you were charged multiple times for a single transaction due to a system error, you are eligible for a refund of the duplicate charges.</p>

            <h5>3.3 Wrong Bundle Delivered</h5>
            <p>If we delivered a different bundle than what you purchased due to our error (e.g., 1GB instead of 5GB), you are eligible for either:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
              <li>The correct bundle to be delivered, or</li>
              <li>A refund of the difference in price</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3.4 System Error</h5>
            <p>If our system processed your payment but shows no record of the transaction, preventing delivery, you are eligible for a full refund or redelivery.</p>

            <h5>3.5 Service Unavailability</h5>
            <p>If the network provider's service is unavailable and we cannot deliver the bundle within 24 hours of purchase, you are eligible for a full refund.</p>
          </div>

          <!-- Not Eligible for Refund -->
          <div class="policy-section">
            <h3>4. Circumstances NOT Eligible for Refund</h3>
            <p>Refunds will NOT be issued in the following circumstances:</p>

              <li>Purchasing for an inactive or barred number</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>4.2 Change of Mind</h5>
            <p>Once a bundle is successfully delivered, refunds are not issued simply because you:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">
              <li>Changed your mind about the purchase</li>
              <li>Found a better price elsewhere</li>
              <li>Decided you don't need the bundle</li>
              <li>No longer want to use that phone number</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>4.3 Bundle Expiration</h5>
            <p>Refunds are not issued for unused data that expires at the end of the validity period. Each bundle clearly states its validity period at the time of purchase.</p>

            <h5>4.4 Network Provider Issues</h5>
            <p>We are not responsible for issues caused by the network provider after successful delivery, including:</p>
            <ul class="policy-list">

            </ul>
